<p>I was given the opportunity to pursue a Master’s in Public Administration
programme with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.&nbsp; The academic
work and interactions with participants from various agencies and countries
was an eye-opener for me and helped me further appreciate the public sector
and policies beyond what I learnt from audit work.&nbsp; I also work with
experienced public accountants from the public and private sectors as a
member of ACRA’s Practice Monitoring Sub Committee. Such engagements promote
audit quality and enhance my understanding of auditing standards and procedures.
The learning journey at AGO never ends and I look forward to the next bound
ahead.</p>

<p>In AGO, there is a strong learning culture with emphasis given to the
learning and development of officers at all levels. Those with longer years
of service continue to upskill themselves professionally. As I have always
been interested in fraud prevention and detection, I took up the Certified
Fraud Examiner qualification which is recognised globally. Through the
programme, I gained knowledge on areas such as complex financial transactions,
investigative techniques and design of effective anti-fraud controls. The
exam fees were sponsored fully by AGO.</p>
