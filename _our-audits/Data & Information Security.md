AGO auditors are bound by law* to safeguard information obtained in the course of its audits and have to comply with applicable Government rules and procedures on handling information. AGO has additional policies and procedures specific to AGO auditors on safeguarding information in the course of audits. For example, the AGO Data Management Policy sets out the principles related to AGO data management and provides guidance on the processes related to the storage and removal of audit data. AGO auditors also undergo training to ensure that they keep abreast of data and information security requirements.
