<p>The audit manuals are developed and maintained by AGO professional committees,
which takes into account relevant guidance from professional and/or international
standards. For example, the AGO Financial Statements Audit Manual has been
developed based on relevant guidance from the Singapore Standards on Auditing
(SSAs) issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants. The
audit procedures are designed to meet SSA requirements to the best extent
possible. As a member of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit
Institutions (INTOSAI), the relevant audit manuals (eg the Selective Audit
