<p>I was given the opportunity pursue a Master’s in Public Administration
programme with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.&nbsp; The academic
work and interactions with participants from various agencies and countries
was an eye-opener for me and helped me further appreciate the public sector
and policies beyond what I learnt from audit work.&nbsp; I also work with
experienced public accountants from the public and private sectors as a
member of ACRA’s Practice Monitoring Sub Committee. Such engagements promote
audit quality and enhance my understanding of auditing standards and procedures.
The learning journey at AGO never ends and I look forward to the next bound
ahead.</p>

<p>In AGO, there is a strong learning culture with emphasis given to the
learning and development of officers at all levels. Those with longer years
of service continue to upskill themselves professionally. As I have always
been interested in fraud prevention and detection, I took up the Certified
Fraud Examiner qualification which is recognised globally. Through the
programme, I gained knowledge on areas such as complex financial transactions,
investigative techniques and design of effective anti-fraud controls. The
exam fees were sponsored fully by AGO.

<p>As a member of the Digital Innovation Office (DIO) at AGO, our team focuses
on data analytics and automation, streamlining audit processes and introducing
innovative dimensions to audits. I was given the opportunity to pursue
a full-time Master of IT in Business (Analytics) from SMU in 2020, and
this equipped me to introduce advanced techniques like machine learning
and graph analytics into our audit tests. The progress in data science
and automation have transformed our audit approaches. I am excited about
how these initiatives can enhance AGO’s role as the national auditor.

<p>AGO has provided me with many opportunities, as I have had the opportunity
to go through two internal postings within AGO and two external secondments
outside of AGO. In 2022, I was on a 6-month attachment at a private audit
firm, where I got to experience working in the private sector and understand
their work culture and audit practices. I also had hands-on experience
on their analytical tools and audit platform which I believe is relevant
even in the public sector due to the rampant move towards more digitalization.
My current 2-year secondment stint at MOF has been an eye-opening experience
thus far, which has exposed me to the whole-of-government budgetary framework
and handling of policy-related work. Based on my experience thus far, AGO
presents #onecareermanyopportunites. It has been a very fulfilling journey
and reaffirms to me why I chose AGO in the first place.</p>
