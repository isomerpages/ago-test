<p><em>"Interning at AGO had been a very fruitful learning experience where I was given many opportunities to have hands-on experience in auditing a government fund. I was also exposed to various data toolsets such as Tableau which allowed me to analyze and present a huge amount of data into comprehensive charts to give greater insights."</em>
