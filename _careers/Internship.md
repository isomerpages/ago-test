				<em>"Interning at AGO had been a very fruitful learning experience where I was given many opportunities to have
					hands-on experience in auditing a government fund. I was also exposed to various data toolsets such as Tableau
					which allowed me to analyze and present a huge amount of data into comprehensive charts to give greater
					insights."</em>
