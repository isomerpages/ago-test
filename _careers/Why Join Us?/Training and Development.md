AGO Auditors can also tap on training opportunities provided by AGO’s overseas counterparts and seminars/conferences organised by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institution (INTOSAI) and other regional associations of Supreme Audit Institutions of which AGO is a member.

AGO encourages and provides sponsorship for officers to attain relevant professional certifications such as Chartered Accountant (Singapore), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Certified Internal Auditor (CIA), and Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). AGO is an Accredited Training Organisation for the Chartered Accountants of Singapore.

AGO also support our officers in maintaining their professional membership with the professional bodies for the professional accreditation and certifications under the Sponsorship Scheme, where officers can claim up to a certain amount for each accreditation or certification per calendar year.
