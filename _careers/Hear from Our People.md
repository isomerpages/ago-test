<p>“As a final-year accountancy undergraduate in Nanyang Technological University,
I was looking out for a career which was different from the conventional
route to join one of the Big Four accounting firms. The audit findings
flagged by AGO auditors piqued my interest and the role of a government
auditor appeared to be a meaningful role in which my skills and training
could be put to impactful use for a wider public purpose.”</p>

<p>“My work in AGO has been both challenging and fulfilling. In AGO, I have
been exposed to both external auditing and policy work. I was also part
of the team that helped to implement the Quality Assurance Framework in
AGO. The patient coaching, guidance and encouragement that I received from
my bosses and colleagues have also helped me to grow. Seeing my colleagues’
dedication and commitment to serving the nation has inspired and motivated
me to emulate their professionalism as national auditors.”</p>

<p>“The opportunity to audit government ministries and agencies which are
key establishments in Singapore allows me, being a Singaporean, to do something
for my nation using what I have been trained in. Today, auditing takes
on a new meaning and purpose for me. It is no longer business as usual
but unusual business – auditing with a mission: to see that public funds
are well spent and accounted for.”</p>

<p>“Although bonded, I was given a choice of government agency to serve in.
I was impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of AGO officers
in their work during my internship. The AGO is supportive of staff upgrading.
It sponsors officers to take examinations leading to professional certifications
such as chartered financial analyst (CFA), certified internal auditor and
certified information system auditor.”</p>
