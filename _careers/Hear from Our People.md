I was given the opportunity pursue a Master’s in Public Administration programme with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.&nbsp; The academic work and interactions with participants from various agencies and countries was an eye-opener for me and helped me further appreciate the public sector and policies beyond what I learnt from audit work.&nbsp; I also work with experienced public accountants from the public and private sectors as a member of ACRA’s Practice Monitoring Sub Committee. Such engagements promote audit quality and enhance my understanding of auditing standards and procedures. The learning journey at AGO never ends and I look forward to the next bound ahead.

In AGO, there is a strong learning culture with emphasis given to the learning and development of officers at all levels. Those with longer years of service continue to upskill themselves professionally. As I have always been interested in fraud prevention and detection, I took up the Certified Fraud Examiner qualification which is recognised globally. Through the programme, I gained knowledge on areas such as complex financial transactions, investigative techniques and design of effective anti-fraud controls. The exam fees were sponsored fully by AGO.

          As a member of the Digital Innovation Office (DIO) at AGO, our team focuses on data analytics and automation, streamlining audit processes and introducing innovative dimensions to audits. I was given the opportunity to pursue a full-time Master of IT in Business (Analytics) from SMU in 2020, and this equipped me to introduce advanced techniques like machine learning and graph analytics into our audit tests. The progress in data science and automation have transformed our audit approaches. I am excited about how these initiatives can enhance AGO’s role as the national auditor._

         AGO has provided me with many opportunities, as I have had the opportunity to go through two internal postings within AGO and two external secondments outside of AGO. In 2022, I was on a 6-month attachment at a private audit firm, where I got to experience working in the private sector and understand their work culture and audit practices. I also had hands-on experience on their analytical tools and audit platform which I believe is relevant even in the public sector due to the rampant move towards more digitalization. My current 2-year secondment stint at MOF has been an eye-opening experience thus far, which has exposed me to the whole-of-government budgetary framework and handling of policy-related work. Based on my experience thus far, AGO presents #onecareermanyopportunites. It has been a very fulfilling journey and reaffirms to me why I chose AGO in the first place.
