<p>Teng Fei Lin, Deputy Director
<br><em>(Recipient of the 2021 National Day Award (NDA) Commendation Medal)</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Commendation Medal was awarded to Fei Lin in recognition of her commendable performance and devotion to her duties.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s hear from her on her thoughts on receiving the NDA.</p>
<p><strong>What does receiving the award mean for you?</strong> 
<br>I am honoured to be awarded with the National Day Commendation Medal.&nbsp;
It serves as a form of recognition for my contributions to the organisation
over the years.</p>
<p><strong>What is your most memorable contribution to the public service?</strong> 
<br>I have spent a large part of my career with AGO auditing GIC. Over the
years, the team put our heads together and worked on many initiatives to
automate or streamline the audit processes. Some examples are automating
checks on valuation of investments and review of user access rights to
IT systems, using data analytical/visualization tools to gain valuable
insights from big datasets quickly and accurately, and streamlining the
process to generate/update audit documentation. Seeing a more efficient
audit process and an improvement on the quality of the audit over the years
are extremely satisfying and certainly what I see as a key part of my contribution
to the public service. A big thank you to all who have contributed to the
GIC audit team throughout this memorable journey.</p>
<p><strong>Being a recipient of the award, how would you inspire others?</strong> 
<br>Do your best and your contributions, no matter how small will be noticed.</p>

<p><em>Mdm Chua Pheck Kiang Rina, Assistant Auditor-General (AAG)</em>  <em>[Recipient of the 2019 NDA&nbsp;Public Administration&nbsp;Medal (Silver)]</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being an auditor and serving the nation for 29 years, Rina started out
as an Audit Officer with SND group. She was subsequently rotated to other
groups such as SB5 and SB1, and was involved in the audits of GIC, Ministry
of National Development and Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The Public Administration Medal (Silver) was awarded to Rina in recognition
of her contributions to the audit work of AGO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s hear from her on her thoughts on receiving the NDA below.</p>
<p><strong>What were your thoughts when you heard that you would be receiving this award?</strong> 
<br>My first thought is to thank Team AGO - without everyone’s support the
award would not have been possible. I am also happy and honoured as the
award is a form of recognition of the important work we do at AGO.</p>
<p><strong>What do you enjoy about working in AGO? What keeps you motivated at work?</strong> 
<br>In the course of our audit, we get to see and understand the processes
involved in the wide variety of work performed by different Government
agencies. This keeps the job interesting as there is always something new
we learn in every audit assignment. This, coupled with the meaningful work
AGO does in enhancing public accountability and helping to strengthen financial
governance, has kept me motivated all these years.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give the newly joined officers?</strong> 
<br>I think my advice would apply to all officers – firstly, the importance
of taking ownership for one’s work and not pushing the responsibility to
someone else when things did not work out. To me taking ownership for any
problems or issues would spur one to find a solution to the problem or
issue. Secondly, the importance of keeping an open mind and constantly
looking at ways to improve the way things are being done. And finally,
it is fine to make mistakes but more importantly one must own up to and
learn from the mistakes.</p>
