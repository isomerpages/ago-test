<h3><strong>AGO Auditing Service Scholarship</strong></h3>
<p><strong>As the nation’s auditor, AGO believes in nurturing outstanding and talented individuals who desire to serve Singapore and are interested in pursuing a fulfilling career in public sector auditing.</strong>
</p>
<p>AGO plays an important role in enhancing public accountability and governance

and use of public resources through various types of audits. Our observations
include system weaknesses, non-compliance with control procedures or legislation,
and instances of excess, extravagance, or gross inefficiency leading to
waste in the use of public funds and resources.</p>
<p>If you are a driven individual with an analytical and enquiring mind and
would like to make a difference in the public sector, we encourage you
to apply for the Auditing Service Scholarship. The scholarship promises
