AGO organised a Data Challenge for Accountancy undergraduates over a period of two months from August to October 2021.

In addition to several chit chat sessions to give the participants an understanding of AGO auditorsâ€™ work, the participants also had the opportunity to attend a Virtual Tableau Workshop.

During the Final Round of the Data Challenge for Accountancy undergraduates held on 16 Oct 2021, all teams applied the knowledge and skills acquired from the Tableau workshop to their presentations. They shared interesting insights derived from the case study, provided in-depth analyses and effective data visualisations.

The 2021 Data Challenge concluded on 30 Oct 2021, with a prize presentation ceremony.
