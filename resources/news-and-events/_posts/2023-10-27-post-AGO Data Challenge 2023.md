AGO organized the Data Challenge 2023, held from August to October 2023, for undergraduates pursuing different disciplines such as Business (Banking & Finance), Economics, Statistics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Accountancy.

In addition to participating for the Data Challenge, shortlisted students were given the opportunity to attend an in-house Tableau Workshop to equip them with the knowledge of using visualization software.

The final round of the Data Challenge was held on 14 October 2023 where the teams applied the skills acquired during the Tableau Workshop to their presentations, and presented it to a panel of judges. The Data Challenge concluded with a prize presentation ceremony and a chit chat session where students spoke with the Auditor-General and AGO officers to gain a better understanding of AGO and its work.
