*AG addressing participants at the talk* 

AGO organised the Scholarship and Career Talk on 9 February 2023. We were glad to host the students from various universities, JCs and Polytechnics. The event started off with opening remarks from Auditor-General Goh Soon Poh, followed by a sharing on AGO and its roles, and an interesting audit finding by an AGO officer. The students were also informed of the scholarship and career opportunities in AGO by Director, Corporate Development. It was indeed an informative and fulfilling session.
