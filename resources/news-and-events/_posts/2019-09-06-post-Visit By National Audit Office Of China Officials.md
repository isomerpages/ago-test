On 6 September 2019, three officials from the National Audit Office of China (CNAO) visited AGO. The visit was organised as part of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) Master in Public Administration and Management (MPAM) 2019 Externship Programme. Targeted at middle-to-senior level  officials from government administration and state enterprises, the MPAM programme is an integral component of the framework agreement signed between the Singapore and Chinese Governments on exchanges and training of officials.  

The three students from the 2019 MPAM intake who visited AGO were Mr Wang Xiaofeng, Director, 3rd Audit Department, Investment Division; Ms Ke Fang, Director, Audit Planning Management Department, Chongqing Municipal Bureau; and Mr Fu Yunkun, Director, Administrative Audit Department, Yunnan Provincial Bureau. 

GRD Juay Hiang hosted their visit to AGO and briefed them on the role and work of AGO. This was followed by a lively exchange on the experiences of national auditors in both countries.
