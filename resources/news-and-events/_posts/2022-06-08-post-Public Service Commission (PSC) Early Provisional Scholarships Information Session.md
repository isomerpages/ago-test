AGO participated in the PSC Early Provisional Scholarships Information Session at Lifelong Learning Institute on 4 June 2022. It was an engaging session for both our AGO ambassadors and the students as we shared with them more about PSC Scholarships, AGO Auditing Service Scholarship, and what a career in AGO would entail.
