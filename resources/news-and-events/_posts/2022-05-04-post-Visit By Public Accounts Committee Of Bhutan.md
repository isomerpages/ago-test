On 4 May 2022, the Chairperson of Bhutan’s Public Accounts Committee, Honorable Dil Maya Rai, visited AGO. She was accompanied by the Deputy Chairperson, Honorable Gyambo Tshering, three PAC members, Honorable Phuntsho Rapten,  Honorable Hemant Gurung, Honorable Ugyen Tshering and PAC Secretary Mr Tshering Wangchuk. The visitors were warmly welcomed by AG. 

Honorable Dil Maya Rai said that the PAC’s visit to Singapore was to find out more about AGO’s work. The delegation had also visited Parliament earlier in the day.

The delegates were briefed on the role and work of AGO by Dir Winston. This was followed by an engaging discussion on various matters including AGO’s process of identifying agencies for audit, and AGO’s working relationship with Singapore PAC.
