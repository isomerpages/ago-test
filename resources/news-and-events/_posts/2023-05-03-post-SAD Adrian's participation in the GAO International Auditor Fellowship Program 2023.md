<p><em>2023 IAFP Fellows at GAO Headquarters in Washington, D.C.</em>
</p>
<p>Senior Assistant Director Adrian Soh participated in the United States
Government Accountability Office (GAO)’s International Auditor Fellowship
Program (IAFP) scheduled from 3 May 2023 to 28 July 2023.</p>
<p>The year 2023 saw the resumption of the IAFP, which was halted since 2020
due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Adrian was one of 10 fellows representing
8 countries: Albania, Georgia, Greece, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Slovak Republic and Uganda.</p>
<p>The IAFP is part of GAO’s efforts to strengthen the capacity of Supreme
Audit Institutions (SAI) around the world. It encompasses three elements:
auditing practices, personal and professional development, and cultural
exchange.</p>
<p>Besides classroom sessions and projects, Adrian also attended public sector
conferences, visited the World Bank and participated in learning journeys.
There was a rich cultural exchange with colleagues from GAO and the fellows.</p>
