Senior Assistant Director Adrian Soh participated in the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO)’s International Auditor Fellowship Program (IAFP) scheduled from 3 May 2023 to 28 July 2023.

The year 2023 saw the resumption of the IAFP, which was halted since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Adrian was one of 10 fellows representing 8 countries: Albania, Georgia, Greece, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovak Republic and Uganda.

The IAFP is part of GAO’s efforts to strengthen the capacity of Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) around the world. It encompasses three elements: auditing practices, personal and professional development, and cultural exchange.

Besides classroom sessions and projects, Adrian also attended public sector conferences, visited the World Bank and participated in learning journeys. There was a rich cultural exchange with colleagues from GAO and the fellows.
