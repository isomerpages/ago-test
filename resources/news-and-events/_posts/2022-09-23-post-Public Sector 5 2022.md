The Public Sector 5 (ACRA, AGD, AGO, IRAS and MOF) Outreach and Networking Event held on 23 September 2022 at NUS Shaw Foundation Alumni House saw a total of more than 100 sign-ups from the various universities. It was heartening to see the students engaging the agencies enthusiastically to find out about the work they do. The Q&A session led by panel speakers from the 5 agencies was well-received and we saw many interesting questions posed by the students.
