The Public Service Commission (PSC) Scholarships Award Ceremony was held on 20 July 2022. We are happy to see Mr Ryan Ng, a PSC (Public Finance) Scholar receiving his scholarship certificate from Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education, and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service during the ceremony. Ryan will be commencing his degree in Accounting and Finance with University of Manchester in September this year. We would like to wish him all the best for his studies and we look forward to him joining AGO upon graduation.
