*ADAA delegates with AGO representatives.*

On 7 October 2022, the Acting Executive Director (Audit Sector) of the Abu Dhabi Accountability Authority (ADAA), Mr Wael Abdul Qader, visited AGO. He was accompanied by Mr Mahmoud Al Alawi, Chairman’s Advisor; Mr Ahmed Al Hammadi, Section Head Legal Consulting; Mr Mohammed Al Ketbi, Integrity and Anti-Corruption Sector, and Mrs Hasina Al Adawi, Principal Auditor. 

After a warm welcome by Assistant Auditor-General Ng Wee Ling, AGO officials shared with the delegates an overview of AGO’s role and work, digital transformation journey, and training programmes.  

In turn, ADAA also shared on the work that ADAA does. 

It was a fruitful and enriching day for both AGO and ADAA, with engaging lively discussions in both sessions.
