The Assembly began with the outgoing Chair of ASOSAI, His Excellency Mr Tran Sy Thanh, giving delegates a warm welcome. The ASOSAI Chair highlighted the importance of coming together as a community to identify timely initiatives and solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by an update on the developments since the last ASOSAI Assembly in 2018, and the adoption of the Bangkok Declaration 2021. The Declaration outlines four chapters and twelve principles to guide the ASOSAI community in preparing for the next normal in public sector auditing.

 The 8th ASOSAI Symposium was conducted on 8 September 2021. During the Symposium themed “The ASOSAI and the Next Normal: Resilience amidst Challenges”, representatives from ASOSAI member countries made presentations to share their experiences in the following sub-themes – promoting good governance in the next normal, leveraging advanced technologies for auditing, encouraging the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and responding to disaster and pandemic issues. AD Karishma presented on lessons learned from AGO’s ongoing digital transformation journey. 

 All in all, the ASOSAI Assembly and Symposium was a fruitful and enriching event for all participants. AGO will continue to engage our stakeholders, including our international counterparts at ASEANSAI, ASOSAI and INTOSAI levels.
