On 17 September 2019, a delegation from the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Audit & Inspection Commission visited AGO. The delegation was led by the Commission’s director Mr Kang Seon Seop and comprised of Mr Jeong Jong Il and Mr Choi Jong Hyun. The visit was hosted by Group Director Ng Lip Nin.

The delegates were briefed on the role and work of AGO. This was followed by the delegates briefing AGO officials on the structure and work of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. 

The visit ended following an interesting discussion on both agencies’ efforts in ensuring public accountability and trust.
