On 17 September 2019, a delegation from the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Audit & Inspection Commission visited AGO. The delegation was led by the Commission’s director Mr Kang Seon Seop and comprised of Mr Jeong Jong Il and Mr Choi Jong Hyun.

GRD Lip Nin hosted the visit while Acting DD Christopher briefed the visitors on the role and work of AGO.

The delegates also conducted a briefing on the structure of the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the work done by their division. In addition to the audits of the various divisions within the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Commission is also involved in graft prevention.

The visit ended following an interesting discussion on both agencies’ efforts in ensuring public accountability and trust.
