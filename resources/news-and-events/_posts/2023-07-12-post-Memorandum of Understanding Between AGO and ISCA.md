On 12 July 2023, Auditor-General, Ms Goh Soon Poh, and Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) President, Mr Teo Ser Luck, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a collaboration to train AGO auditors on Financial Forensics and Professional Standards and Ethics.  
  
In line with the AGO 2030 transformation plan on developing our people, this collaboration aims to equip our auditors with relevant skills and competencies in newly identified areas that are critical for AGO’s audits. Our auditors can look forward to deepening their knowledge of financial forensics through training conducted by leading financial forensic experts and carefully-curated case studies. In addition, the MOU provides for ISCA to conduct the annual seminar for AGO auditors on Ethics and Updates on Financial Reporting and Auditing Standards. This allows our auditors to be kept updated of latest developments in the relevant standards and be more aware of unethical practices.
