<blockquote>
<h4><strong>In line with building a learning culture, AGO Academy creates platforms for sharing of knowledge.</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Speakers from both public and private sectors are invited to share on
topics relevant to our work - e.g. developments in the public sector, WOG
cybersecurity initiatives and financial governance.</p>
<p>The Academy also organises regular Lunch &amp; Learn sessions during which
industry experts and AGO officers speak on emerging areas such as the applications
of artificial intelligence and machine learning in AGO, fraud and forensics,
and Environment Social and Governance (ESG) reporting.</p>
