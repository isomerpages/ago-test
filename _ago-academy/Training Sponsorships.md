### Training Sponsorships


<img src="/images/website_overseas.jpg">


AGO Academy encourages and offers sponsorship for officers to attain relevant professional certifications such as Chartered Accountant of Singapore (CA Singapore), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) and Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). This ensures that our officers possess the necessary qualifications for their work.

There are also opportunities to attend training conducted by AGO's overseas counterparts, including the International Auditor Fellowship Programme (IAFP) with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), seminars/conferences organised by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institution (INTOSAI) and other regional associations of Supreme Audit Institutions of which AGO is a member.
